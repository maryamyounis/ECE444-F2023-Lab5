## Pros of TDD:
TDDâ€™s nature of writing tests before implementation ensures that the development teams and the stakeholders all have a consistent understanding and expectation of the project requirements. Next, TDD ensures that the development automates the testing process, which makes sure that the tests continue to be consistent across all stages of development and change in the code. This also gurantees that testing is not an afterthought, but it emphasized throughout all stages of development, leading the teams to be more confident when they deploy their projects at the end.

## Cons of TDD: 
Writing tests before code implementation introduces initial time overhead and investment for developers. This can cause initial delays in the project and increase the development costs if TDD was not take into consideration. In addition, all the test cases need to be continuously updated to reflect any changes in the code itself or in the requirements, adding more overhead for developers all throughout the development cycle. Furthermore, since tests are continuously being run, it may need additional infrastructure like servers to be able to run them.
